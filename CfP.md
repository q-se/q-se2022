# Call for Papers

## Research of Interest

Q-SE welcomes submissions addressing topics across the full spectrum of Quantum
Software Engineering, being inclusive of quantitative, qualitative, and
mixed-methods research.  Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Paradigms for developing quantum software
- Quantum software design
- Quantum software testing
- Quantum software verification
- Quantum software coding practices
- Quantum software reuse
- Quantum software experimentations
- Quantum software execution
- Quantum programming languages
- Industrial applications
- Empirical evaluations

Three types of contributions will be considered:

- **Regular papers** (8 pages, including references): Research or experience reports, research methods, longer challenge papers.
- **Position paper** (4 pages, including references): Describing a well-argued position in any area of quantum software engineering.
- **Fast Abstracts** (2 pages, including references): Work in progress, challenges.

## Evaluation Criteria

(Following [ICSE 2022's review criteria](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2022/icse-2022-papers#review-criteria).)

All submissions submitted electronically through [HotCRP](https://q-se-2022.hotcrp.com)
(the same system used by ICSE in 2022) will be evaluated by at least three program
committee members (aka reviewers).  Each reviewer will evaluate each contribution
for its:

- **Soundness:** The extent to which the paper's contributions and/or
  innovations address its research questions and are supported by rigorous
  application of appropriate research methods.

- **Significance:** The extent to which the paper's contributions can impact the
  field of quantum software engineering, and under which assumptions (if any).

- **Novelty:** The extent to which the contributions are sufficiently original
  with respect to the state-of-the-art.

- **Verifiability and Transparency:** The extent to which the paper includes
  sufficient information to understand how an innovation works; to understand
  how data (if any) was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted; and how the paper
  supports independent verification or replication of the paper's claimed
  contributions.

- **Clarity:** The extent to which the paper's quality of writing meets the high
  standards of Q-SE and ICSE, including clear descriptions, as well as adequate
  use of the English language, absence of major ambiguity, clearly readable
  figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided
  below.

Reviewers will carefully consider all of these criteria during the review
process, and authors should take great care in clearly addressing them all.  The
paper should clearly explain the claimed contributions, and how they are sound,
significant, novel, and verifiable, as described above.

## Paper Submission

(Following [ICSE 2022's Guidelines on how to prepare your submission](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2022/icse-2022-papers#how-to-submit).)

ICSE 2022 workshop proceedings will be prepared by IEEE CPS and published by
ACM.  Thus, workshop papers must follow the
[ACM formatting instructions](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
In other words, all authors should use the official "ACM Primary Article Template",
as can be obtained from the [ACM Proceedings Template page](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
LaTeX users should use the `sigconf` option, as well as the `review` (to produce
line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and `anonymous` (omitting
author names) options.  To that end, the following LaTeX code can be placed at
the start of the LaTeX document:

```
\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}
\acmConference[Q-SE 2022]{The 3rd International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering}{May ??-??, 2022}{Pittsburgh, PA, USA}
```

- All submissions must not exceed the maximum allowed number of pages (i.e.,
  8 pages for regular papers, 4 pages for position papers, and 2 pages for fast
  abstracts), including main text, figures, tables, appendices, and references.
  No extra page will be allowed.

- All submissions must be in PDF.

- Submissions must strictly conform to the **ACM formatting instructions**.
  Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the
  instructions may result in desk rejection without further review.

- By submitting to the Q-SE workshop, authors acknowledge that they are aware of
  and agree to be bound by the [ACM Policy and Procedures on
  Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism) and the
  [IEEE Plagiarism FAQ](https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/plagiarism/plagiarism.html).
  In particular, papers submitted to Q-SE 2022 **must not have been published
  elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere
  whilst under consideration for Q-SE 2022**.  Contravention of this concurrent
  submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and
  appropriate action will be taken in all such cases.  To check for double
  submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share
  the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with
  overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software,
  under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies.

- The Q-SE 2022 workshop will employ a double-anonymous review process.  Thus,
  no submission may reveal its authors' identities.  The authors must make every
  effort to honor the double-anonymous review process.  In particular:

    - **Authors' names** must be omitted from the submission.
    - All **references** to the author's prior work should be in the third person.
    - Authors are encouraged to **title their submission differently** than
  preprints of the authors on ArXiV or similar sites.  During review, authors
  **should not publicly use the submission title**.

  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review
  process can be found in the [ICSE 2022's Q&A page](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2022/icse-2022-submitting-to-icse2022--q-a).

- By submitting to the Q-SE workshop, authors acknowledge that they conform to
  the [authorship policy of the ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/authorship)
  and the [authorship policy of the IEEE](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/definition-of-authorship).

### Submission Link

Submissions to the workshop that meet the above requirements can be made via
[**https://q-se-2022.hotcrp.com**](https://q-se-2022.hotcrp.com) by the submission
deadline.  Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be
desk rejected without further review.

We encourage the authors to upload their paper information early (and submit the
PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous reviewing.  Authors
are encouraged to try out the experimental [SIGSOFT Submission Checker](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/submission-checker)
to detect violations to the formatting and double anonymous guidelines.  (Mind
that the tool is based on heuristics.  Therefore, it may miss violations, and it
can raise false alarms.  The requirements listed in this call for papers take
precedence over the results of the tool when deciding whether a paper meets the
submission guidelines.)

## Withdrawing a Submission

Authors can withdraw their submission at any moment until the final decision has
been made, through the paper submission system.  Resubmitting the paper to
another venue before the final decision has been made without withdrawing from
Q-SE 2022 first is considered a violation of the concurrent submission policy,
and will lead to automatic rejection from Q-SE 2022 as well as any other venue
adhering to this policy.

## Important Dates
