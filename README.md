# 3rd International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering (Q-SE)

Quantum computers promise to solve unthinkably complex problems that traditional
computers could ever solve.  The evidence of such quantum supremacy over
traditional computers has started to emerge as it can be seen by Google's
quantum computer recently performing a complex computation that would take
10,000 years for the best supercomputer available today.  High-level languages
to write quantum programs have also started to appear, e.g., Microsoft's Q# and
IBM's Qiskit.  Thus, we believe that this is the right time to build a community
for quantum software engineering (QSE) focusing on devising methods, approaches,
and processes to develop software for quantum programs efficiently and to ensure
their correctness.  The Q-SE workshop will provide a platform for researchers
and practitioners to discuss the challenges in developing software quantum
software in high-level quantum languages, developing novel solutions to build
correct methods for developing testing quantum programs, executing quantum
software, developing best practices, and creating a research roadmap of quantum
software engineering.

The key goals of the workshop are:

1. Provide practical and generalizable insights on how to apply and extend
existing approaches to quantum software development or develop entirely new
approaches.
2. Devise ways in which industry and academia can collaborate to provide further
knowledge on developing quantum software.
3. Provide academia with feedback on which skills and abilities are required in
quantum software development and where to concentrate on the education of
students.
4. Demonstrate to academia new as well as existing practical challenges in the
field of quantum software engineering.
5. Communicate the latest research findings to practitioners and discuss ways to
adopt them for industrial products, services, and processes.

The key outcomes of the workshop are:

1. Understanding the current state-of-the-art and state of the practice related
to quantum software engineering.
2. Developing a future research roadmap for quantum software engineering.
3. Establishing a new research community in the area of quantum software
engineering through developing a special interest group.

### Workshop Attendance

If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to
register for Q-SE 2022 and present the paper. _We will add more info on this as
soon as the ICSE/Q-SE 2022 format is finalized._

Authors and participants must register through the main conference website: [Registration for ICSE 2022](https://conf.researchr.org/attending/icse-2022/registration).
